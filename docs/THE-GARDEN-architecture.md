## Backups

**Script:** `/opt/plotlines/ops/backup-db.sh`
**Schedule:** Daily at 02:00 UTC via cron
**Destination:** Cloudflare R2 via rclone — `outerfit-backups:outerfit-llc/`
**Contents:**
- `plotlines/plotlines_YYYYMMDD_HHMMSS.sql.gz` — full PostgreSQL dump
- `thread/thread_YYYYMMDD_HHMMSS.sql.gz` — thread DB dump
**Retention:** Last 7 days locally in `/tmp/`, R2 keeps all
**rclone remote:** `outerfit-backups` (S3-compatible, Cloudflare R2)
**Log:** `/opt/plotlines/logs/backup.log`

**Restore:**
```bash
rclone ls outerfit-backups:outerfit-llc/plotlines/   # list backups
rclone copy outerfit-backups:outerfit-llc/plotlines/plotlines_YYYYMMDD_HHMMSS.sql.gz /tmp/
gunzip /tmp/plotlines_YYYYMMDD_HHMMSS.sql.gz
PGPASSWORD=plines2026 psql -h localhost -U plotlines plotlines < /tmp/plotlines_YYYYMMDD_HHMMSS.sql
```

**Security:** Backups are GPG-encrypted before upload (key: `backup@theplotline.net`, private key in Bitwarden "PlotLines Backup GPG Key"). Only `.gpg` files are stored in R2 — unreadable without the private key.

**Restore (encrypted):**
```bash
# Get private key from Bitwarden, import it
bw get notes "PlotLines Backup GPG Key" | gpg --import

# Download and decrypt
rclone copy outerfit-backups:outerfit-llc/plotlines/plotlines_DATE.sql.gz.gpg /tmp/
gpg --decrypt /tmp/plotlines_DATE.sql.gz.gpg | gunzip | PGPASSWORD=plines2026 psql -h localhost -U plotlines plotlines
```

⚠️ **Disk encryption:** Database volume is NOT encrypted at rest (plain ext4/LVM). LUKS full-disk encryption is planned before public launch.

## The Concept

Every morning, a cast of garden characters — each powered by a different LLM with a distinct personality — convenes to discuss the day. Their conversation is grounded in real weather data for the subscriber's location and growing region, a daily philosophical quote, and a rolling three-day memory so characters remember what was said before. The exchange closes with a passage written in the style of the subscriber's chosen American author. Currently: Hemingway.

It is absurdist. It is horticultural. It is oddly wise. It already exists — the script works. The business is just delivering it to people who will pay $1.99/week or $3.99/month to read it over their morning coffee.

---

## The Characters

Each character is a distinct LLM persona with a defined voice, worldview, and conversational style. The cast rotates daily — not every character appears every day — which creates anticipation and variety.

| Character | Voice | Worldview | LLM Temperament |
|-----------|-------|-----------|-----------------|
| **Pedantic Ivy** | Over-educated, Latin binomials, footnotes everything | The garden is a rigorous intellectual discipline | Verbose, corrects everyone |
| **Harry Kvetch** | Perpetually aggrieved, everything is harder than it looks | Gardening is suffering and he loves it | Complains beautifully |
| **Poppy Seed Buster** | Native plant evangelist, deeply grounded | The land was here before the garden | Wise, occasionally unsettling |
| **Buck Thorn** | Weathered pragmatist, has done this for 40 years | Just plant the damn thing | Terse, occasionally profound |
| **Chelsea Flower** | Enthusiastic, trend-aware, slightly exhausting | Gardens should be photographed | Breathless, charming |
| **Young Fern** | New to all of this, asks the questions nobody else will | What even is composting | Earnest, occasionally correct |

THE GARDEN
Wednesday, March 4, 2026
Denver, Colorado — Zone 5b
High 44°F, partly cloudy, light wind from the northwest

"The glory of gardening: hands in the dirt, head in the sun,
heart with nature." — Alfred Austin

─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────

PEDANTIC IVY: I have noted — and I must insist on noting —
that the Helleborus orientalis you mentioned yesterday,
Buck, is technically in its vernalization period and...

HARRY KVETCH: Again with the Latin. My tomatoes died last
year. Died. In May. Can we talk about that?

YOUNG FERN: Wait, what's vernalization?

BUCK THORN: Cold makes things grow. Keep moving.

PEDANTIC IVY: That is a grotesque oversimplification of
a complex physiological process involving...

HARRY KVETCH: [sighing audibly]

─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────

The ground was still cold the way ground stays cold long
after the calendar has moved on. The old man knew this.
He had known it for forty years, which is the kind of
knowing that has no argument left in it.

─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────

Tomorrow: Chelsea Flower joins the conversation.
Zone 5b: Last frost date approximately April 28.

## ⚠️ AGENT RULES — READ FIRST

**These are non-negotiable. Violating them breaks production.**

1. **POSTGRES ONLY. ZERO SQLite.** The database is PostgreSQL at `postgresql://plotlines:plines2026@localhost:5432/plotlines`. There is no SQLite, no `plotlines.db`, no `better-sqlite3`, no `sqlite3` Python module, no `:memory:` anything. Not in production code. Not in tests. Not in seed scripts. Not in comments. Zero. None. If you write `import sqlite3` or `require('better-sqlite3')`, you are wrong.

2. **Emails are encrypted.** The `subscribers.email` column is BYTEA (`pgp_sym_encrypt`). To read an email: `pgp_sym_decrypt(email::bytea, $1)::text`. The key is `DB_ENCRYPTION_KEY` env var (`tZF6qDVgW5JXCR2koeTy2SbepwAP+h8xKwnfRDYbNq8=`). Same for `location_city`, `location_state`, `lat_enc`, `lon_enc`, `zipcode`. Never store or log plaintext email.

3. **Tests must test the real pipeline.** Tests that pass while the app is broken are worse than no tests. The test suite is `test_pipeline.py` (Python, pytest) + `__tests__/*.test.js` (Node, Jest). Both must run against real Postgres. No mocks for DB queries.

4. **The Python pipeline scripts read from Postgres.** `garden-dispatch.py`, `garden-assembler.py`, `garden-mailer.py`, `garden-daily-v3.py` all use `psycopg2` to connect to Postgres. The `DATABASE_URL` and `DB_ENCRYPTION_KEY` are loaded from `/opt/plotlines/.env`.

5. **Climate zones: 28 zones, exact names matter.** Old names (`alaska`, `humid_southeast`, `upper_midwest`) no longer exist in the DB or code. Use the current names listed in the Climate Zones section below. If you see an old name anywhere — in code, DB, or tests — fix it.

6. **Run tests before committing.** After any change: `cd /opt/plotlines/server && npm test` and `python3 -m pytest ~/openclaw/skills/garden-conversation/test_pipeline.py -v`. Both must pass green.

## Technical Architecture

### Infrastructure

Runs on the same Outerfit LLC VPS (DatabaseMart RTX Pro 4000 Ada). Completely separate codebase and database but shared infrastructure. Zero additional hosting cost.

```
outerfit.net VPS
├── outerfit/          (existing)
│   └── server/
│       └── (outerfit app)
└── thegarden/         (new)
    ├── server/        (Fastify — different port, same machine)
    ├── client/        (React + Vite — signup page only)
    ├── scripts/       (existing LLM conversation script)
    └── data/
        └── garden.db  (SQLite — separate from outerfit.db)
```

Caddy handles both domains on the same machine:

```
# Caddyfile addition
thegarden.email {
    reverse_proxy localhost:3001
}
```

### Tech Stack

| Component | Technology | Notes |
|-----------|------------|-------|
| Signup app | React + Vite | Single page — email, region, author, frequency |
| Backend | Fastify 4.x (port 3001) | Separate from outerfit (port 3000) |
| Database | PostgreSQL | `postgresql://plotlines@localhost:5432/plotlines` — migrated from SQLite |
| LLM calls | Python engine | `server/garden/engine.py` — spawned per combo, output JSON |
| Weather | NWS + Open-Meteo fallback | NWS for US stations, Open-Meteo international |
| Email | SMTP (nodemailer) | Confirmation + daily dispatch + gift emails |
| Payments | Stripe | Checkout, webhooks, referrals, gifts, beta invites |
| Mastheads | PIL (Python) | Lazy-generated 600×100 PNGs, cached in `/data/mastheads/` |
| Static files | @fastify/static v7 | Serves `/mastheads/` — must use v7 for Fastify 4 compat |
| Scheduling | node-cron | Daily dispatch 6:00 AM |
| Domain | theplotline.net | Cloudflare proxied |

### Daily Dispatch Flow

Runs at 6:00 AM daily (`server/cron/dispatch.js`):

```
For each active location+author combo:
  1. Run Python engine → prose_text, prose_html, topic, quote, weather_summary
  2. Store result in daily_runs table
  3. Get author-voiced season name (micro_seasons table)
  4. Generate newsletter title via generate_title.py (mistral:latest, 30s timeout)
     → 2-3 word poetic title e.g. "Snow's Serenade for Buzzing Blooms"
     → Falls back to static TITLE_DICT[solar_term, weather] on Ollama failure
  5. Generate masthead PNG (two-step, lazy-cached):
     a. generate_art.py (zone, weather) → SD 1.5 botanical art layer (700x200, ~6s)
        → cached in /data/mastheads/art/flux/<hash>.png
     b. generate_masthead.py (station, author, season, weather, --art-layer, --solar-term, --title)
        → PIL composites title + solar term text over art layer
        → cached as station-author-season-weather-term.png in /data/mastheads/
        → served at https://theplotline.net/mastheads/<file>.png
  6. For each active confirmed subscriber in that combo:
     → sendDailyEmail() with masthead_url + prose + footer links
     → Record delivery in deliveries table
```

**Weather type normalization** (`server/services/weather.js → detectWeatherType()`):
Valid types: `sunny`, `cloudy`, `rainy`, `snowy`, `frost`, `heat`
NWS descriptions like `partly_cloudy`, `foggy`, `stormy` are normalized to valid types.
Default fallback: `cloudy` (never passes invalid type to masthead script).

**Title generation** (`server/services/generate_title.py`):
- Model: `mistral:latest` via Ollama (localhost:11434)
- Timeout: 30s
- Fallback: static `TITLE_DICT[(solar_term, weather)]` lookup
- Static fallback of last resort: `"Patience"`
- ⚠️ Was broken 2026-03-06: timeout was 3s (always fell back), phi4 was too slow.
  Fixed: switched to mistral, bumped timeout to 30s.

**Art generation** (`skills/garden-conversation/generate_art.py`):
- Model: SD 1.5 (`runwayml/stable-diffusion-v1-5`) via diffusers
- ~6s generation, 700x200px, flat botanical illustration style
- Prompt built from zone + weather + solar term
- ⚠️ Was not wired into dispatch until 2026-03-06 — every masthead was text-only solid color.
  Fixed: dispatch now runs generate_art.py first, passes result as --art-layer.

**Email footer links** (all use `email+token` for auth):
- Manage subscription → `/manage?email=&token=`
- Invite a friend → `/manage?email=&token=#invite`
- Gift a subscription → `/manage?email=&token=#gift`
- Cancel → `/manage?email=&token=#cancel`

### Stripe Payments

**Plans:**
- Weekly: $1.99/week
- Monthly: $3.99/month
- Annual: $40/year

**Flow:**
1. User subscribes via `/api/subscribe` → gets confirmation email with token
2. Confirms email → status changes to 'active' (unconfirmed → active)
3. User clicks "Subscribe" → `/api/stripe/create-checkout` → Stripe Checkout session
4. Stripe webhook `/api/webhooks/stripe` receives:
   - `checkout.session.completed` → activate subscription, backfill zipcode + re-geocode if missing
   - `invoice.paid` → extend subscription_end_date
   - `customer.subscription.deleted` → cancel subscription
   - `invoice.payment_failed` → mark as past_due
5. Referral: user enters referral code at signup → referrer gets free month on referee's first payment
6. Gift: purchaser buys gift code → recipient gets email with code → redeems for free subscription period

**Zipcode Backfill (webhook):**
On `checkout.session.completed`, if the subscriber has no zipcode or no lat/lon, we pull
`customer_details.address.postal_code` from the Stripe session and:
- Store the zipcode
- Re-geocode using the zip (more precise than city+state)
- Update lat/lon and climate_zone_id
This ensures subscribers who skip the optional zip field still get correctly zoned.

**Beta Invite System:**
- Beta codes (`BETA-*`) bypass payment during checkout
- Used for early access, press, friends & family
- Tracked in `beta_invite` field on subscriber

### Security & Privacy

**Email encryption at rest (pgcrypto):**
- `subscribers.email` is stored as BYTEA encrypted with `pgp_sym_encrypt(email, DB_ENCRYPTION_KEY)`
- `subscribers.email_hash` is a SHA-256 hex hash of `lower(trim(email))` — used for deduplication lookups
- `DB_ENCRYPTION_KEY` lives in `.env` (gitignored) and Bitwarden "PlotLines DB Encryption Key"
- ⚠️ KEY LOSS = PERMANENT DATA LOSS. Back up before any server migration.
- Location fields (`lat`, `lon`, `zipcode`, `location_city`, `location_state`) also encrypted at rest
- Privacy statement on `/about` page reflects this accurately

**Backup encryption:**
- All R2 backups GPG-encrypted before upload (`backup@theplotline.net` key)
- Private key in Bitwarden "PlotLines Backup GPG Key"
- Old unencrypted backups purged from R2 on 2026-03-06

**What is NOT encrypted:**
- Disk at rest (plain ext4/LVM) — LUKS planned pre-launch
- `climate_zone_id`, `station_code`, `author_key`, `active`, timestamps — non-PII, plaintext for query performance

**Privacy statement** (`/about` page):
> Emails encrypted at rest with AES-256, never stored in plaintext.
> Location data also encrypted at rest.
> Backups GPG-encrypted before leaving our servers.
> Never shared, sold, or rented.

### Location & Climate Zone Resolution

**Signup flow:**
1. User provides city + state (required for US) + optional zipcode
2. Geocode: zipcode preferred (more precise) → fallback to `"city, state"` via Nominatim
3. `assignClimateZone(lat, lon, country)` → `climate_zone_id` (e.g. `high_plains`, `humid_southeast`, `alaska`)
4. US: NWS station lookup for hyper-local weather

**Climate zones** (`server/services/climate.js`) — 28 zones as of 2026-03-06:

*US zones:*
`high_plains` | `pacific_maritime` | `california_med` | `desert_southwest` |
`great_plains` | `great_lakes` | `upper_midwest_continental` | `appalachian` |
`humid_subtropical` | `northeast` | `southern_plains` | `florida_southern` |
`florida_keys_tropical` | `hawaii` | `alaska_interior` | `alaska_south_coastal`

*International:*
`uk_maritime` | `mediterranean_eu` | `central_europe` | `canada_prairie` |
`canada_maritime` | `japan_temperate` | `iceland_subarctic` | `australia_tropical` |
`australia_temperate` | `south_africa_temperate` | `south_africa_subtropical` | `brazil_subtropical`

**Zone naming changes (2026-03-06):**
- `alaska` → split into `alaska_interior` (Fairbanks, Barrow, lat ≥ 64) and `alaska_south_coastal` (Anchorage, Juneau)
- `upper_midwest` → `upper_midwest_continental`
- `humid_southeast` → `humid_subtropical`
- New: `great_lakes` split from `upper_midwest` (lake-effect snow belt: Duluth, Cleveland, Chicago)
- New: `florida_keys_tropical`, `florida_southern`, `desert_southwest`, `southern_plains`, `hawaii`

**Seasonal timing** (`garden_seasons.py` — `ZONE_OFFSETS`):
Each zone has spring/summer/fall/winter day offsets relative to `high_plains` baseline.
- Positive offset = season arrives LATER (e.g. `alaska_south_coastal` spring +14 days)
- Negative offset = season arrives EARLIER (e.g. `florida_keys_tropical` spring -30 days)
- Tropical zones (hawaii, florida_keys_tropical) have near-zero winter offset — no real winter

**Sub-region lookup** (`server/services/sub-regions.js`):
Two-pass: lat/lon bounding boxes → NWS station code fallback.
~100 sub-regions → 28 climate zones. Sub-regions inject location-specific flavor text
into LLM prompts ("You garden in the Willamette Valley..."). Zone handles timing; sub-region handles voice.

**Admin KPI date semantics:**
- `created_at` — immutable, original signup timestamp
- `confirmed_at` — set once on first email confirmation
- `subscribed_at` — updated on every reactivation; used for "New today" KPI
- `unsubscribed_at` / `cancelled_at` — set on cancel

### Database Schema

**Database:** PostgreSQL 14 at `postgresql://plotlines:plines2026@localhost:5432/plotlines`
**There is no SQLite. There has never been SQLite in production. Do not add any.**

Real tables (from `\dt`): `subscribers`, `combinations`, `climate_zones`, `daily_runs`, `deliveries`, `micro_seasons`, `author_season_names`, `authors`, `mastheads`, `topic_wheel_state`, `referrals`, `gifts`, `beta_invites`

### The Dispatch Engine

**The Python pipeline is the production dispatch engine.** The Node.js server handles web/API/Stripe only — it does NOT send emails.

**Scripts** (all in `~/openclaw/skills/garden-conversation/`):

| Script | Role |
|--------|------|
| `garden-dispatch.py` | Orchestrator — runs the full DAG end to end |
| `garden-assembler.py` | Assembles HTML email from dialogue + masthead |
| `garden-mailer.py` | Sends emails via Resend |
| `garden-daily-v3.py` | Dialogue generation — calls LLMs per character |
| `generate_art.py` | SD 1.5 botanical art generation |
| `generate_masthead.py` | PIL compositing — art layer + title text |
| `garden_seasons.py` | Solar term + zone offset lookup |

**All scripts connect to Postgres via `psycopg2`.** `DATABASE_URL` + `DB_ENCRYPTION_KEY` from `/opt/plotlines/.env`.

**DAG stages (garden-dispatch.py):**
1. Load combinations + subscribers from Postgres (joined query, decrypts email)
2. Fetch weather per NWS station (cached per run-date)
3. Generate art per zone+condition (SD 1.5, cached by hash)
4. Generate dialogue per combo (LLMs, cached per run-date)
5. Generate title (mistral:latest, 30s timeout, fallback dict)
6. Composite masthead (PIL, art layer + text)
7. Assemble HTML email
8. Send via Resend, record in `deliveries` table

**Cron:** 5:30 AM Mountain daily via OpenClaw cron.

**Run manually:**
```bash
cd ~/openclaw/skills/garden-conversation
python3 garden-dispatch.py --dry-run        # test without sending
python3 garden-dispatch.py                  # real run
python3 garden-dispatch.py --date 2026-03-06  # specific date
```

**Legacy pseudocode (IGNORE — this is NOT how it works):**
```javascript
// THIS IS OLD. DO NOT IMPLEMENT. The real engine is Python.
// Kept for concept reference only.
import cron from 'node-cron'
import { generateConversation } from './gardenConversation.js'  // existing script

// Run at 6am daily — gives time to generate before 7am delivery
cron.schedule('0 6 * * *', async () => {
  const today = new Date().toISOString().split('T')[0]

  // Get all active subscribers due today
  const subscribers = db.execAll(`
    SELECT * FROM subscribers
    WHERE status = 'active'
    AND (
      frequency = 'daily'
      OR (frequency = 'weekly' AND weekly_day = ?)
    )
  `, [getDayName()])

  for (const subscriber of subscribers) {
    try {
      await generateAndSend(subscriber, today)
    } catch (err) {
      log.error({ err, subscriber_id: subscriber.id }, 'Dispatch failed')
      db.run(`
        UPDATE dispatch_log SET status = 'failed', error_message = ?
        WHERE subscriber_id = ? AND dispatch_date = ?
      `, [err.message, subscriber.id, today])
    }
  }
})

async function generateAndSend(subscriber, date) {
  // 1. Get rolling 3-day history
  const history = db.execAll(`
    SELECT * FROM conversation_history
    WHERE subscriber_id = ?
    ORDER BY dispatch_date DESC LIMIT 3
  `, [subscriber.id])

  // 2. Get weather for subscriber location
  const weather = await weatherService.getForecast({
    latitude: subscriber.latitude,
    longitude: subscriber.longitude,
    days: 1
  })

  // 3. Select today's quote
  const quote = selectQuote(weather.condition, getCurrentSeason(subscriber.latitude))

  // 4. Select today's character roster (3-4 of 6)
  const characters = selectCharacters(date, history)

  // 5. Generate conversation (existing script)
  const { conversation, authorPassage } = await generateConversation({
    characters,
    weather: weather.today,
    quote,
    history: history.map(h => h.conversation),
    region: subscriber.region,
    author: subscriber.author_voice,
    season: getCurrentSeason(subscriber.latitude),
  })

  // 6. Save to history
  db.run(`
    INSERT INTO conversation_history
    (subscriber_id, dispatch_date, characters, conversation, author_passage, weather_summary, quote_used)
    VALUES (?, ?, ?, ?, ?, ?, ?)
  `, [subscriber.id, date, JSON.stringify(characters),
      conversation, authorPassage,
      JSON.stringify(weather.today), quote.text])

  // 7. Render and send email
  await emailService.sendGardenDispatch({
    to: subscriber.email,

  })

  // 8. Log success
  db.run(`
    UPDATE dispatch_log SET status = 'sent', sent_at = CURRENT_TIMESTAMP
    WHERE subscriber_id = ? AND dispatch_date = ?
  `, [subscriber.id, date])
}
```

### Character Rotation Logic

Characters rotate to create variety and anticipation. Not all six appear every day.

```javascript
function selectCharacters(date, history) {
  const ALL_CHARACTERS = [
    'pedantic_ivy', 'harry_kvetch', 'poppy_seed_buster',
    'buck_thorn', 'chelsea_flower', 'young_fern'
  ]

  // Always include at least Buck Thorn (grounding presence)
  // Always include at least one "voice of confusion" (Young Fern or Harry)
  // Rotate the other 1-2 slots

  const dayOfYear = getDayOfYear(date)
  const rotation  = dayOfYear % 3

  const ROSTERS = [
    ['buck_thorn', 'harry_kvetch', 'pedantic_ivy', 'young_fern'],
    ['buck_thorn', 'chelsea_flower', 'poppy_seed_buster', 'harry_kvetch'],
    ['buck_thorn', 'young_fern', 'pedantic_ivy', 'chelsea_flower'],
  ]

  return ROSTERS[rotation]
}
```

### LLM Character Prompts

Each character is a system prompt passed to a different API call. The existing script handles this — documenting the structure here for reference.

```javascript
const CHARACTER_PROMPTS = {
  pedantic_ivy: `
    You are Pedantic Ivy, a garden character who has a PhD in botany
    from Yale and cannot stop referencing it. You use Latin binomials
    for everything. You are not unkind, just constitutionally incapable
    of simplicity. You remember previous conversations and may reference
    them with footnote-like precision.
  `,

  harry_kvetch: `
    You are Harry Kvetch, a garden character for whom gardening is
    a love language expressed entirely through complaint. Everything
    is harder than it should be. The weather is always wrong. You
    have been at this for thirty years and you wouldn't stop for
    anything. Your complaints are the highest form of devotion.
  `,

  poppy_seed_buster: `
    You are Poppy Seed Buster, a Native American garden character
    with deep knowledge of the land that predates the garden by
    centuries. You speak sparingly. When you speak, people should
    listen. You have a dry, occasionally unsettling humor. You
    remember the three-day history with the patience of someone
    who thinks in seasons, not days.
  `,

  buck_thorn: `
    You are Buck Thorn. You have been gardening for forty years.
    You are not interested in theory. You speak in short sentences.
    You are occasionally profound by accident. You do not explain
    yourself. The land teaches you things and you act on them.
  `,

  chelsea_flower: `
    You are Chelsea Flower, enthusiastic about everything in the
    garden, especially how it photographs. You are aware of trends.
    You are genuinely knowledgeable beneath the enthusiasm, which
    surprises people. You reference Instagram without irony.
    You are charming in a way that occasionally irritates the others.
  `,

  young_fern: `
    You are Young Fern. You are new to gardening. You ask the
    questions that everyone else has forgotten they once had.
    You are earnest. You are occasionally accidentally correct
    in ways that embarrass Pedantic Ivy. You remember the
    three-day history because you wrote everything down.
  `,
}

const AUTHOR_PROMPTS = {
  hemingway: `
    Write a closing passage of 3-5 sentences in the style of
    Ernest Hemingway. Short sentences. No adjectives that do not
    earn their place. The land. The work. What the season means
    to the people in it. Do not mention Hemingway. Just write.
  `,
  // Future: Didion, Thoreau, Morrison, Steinbeck, Berry
}
```

## Business Model

### Pricing

| Tier | Price | Annual equiv | Notes |
|------|-------|-------------|-------|
| Weekly | $1.99/mo | $23.88/yr | Monday morning dispatch |
| Daily | $3.99/mo | $47.88/yr | Every morning |

No free tier. No trial. A sample dispatch on the signup page does the job.

### Unit Economics

| Metric | Value |
|--------|-------|
| LLM cost per dispatch (6 API calls) | ~$0.02-0.05 |
| Email cost per dispatch (Resend) | ~$0.001 |
| Total COGS per dispatch | ~$0.05 |
| Daily subscriber margin | $3.99 - ($0.05 × 30) = $2.49/mo |
| Weekly subscriber margin | $1.99 - ($0.05 × 4) = $1.79/mo |
| Gross margin (blended) | ~60-65% |

At 500 subscribers (60% daily, 40% weekly):
```
Daily:    300 × $3.99  = $1,197/mo gross
Weekly:   200 × $1.99  = $398/mo gross
Total:                   $1,595/mo gross
COGS:                    ~$570/mo
Net:                     ~$1,025/mo
```

Shared infrastructure means zero additional hosting cost beyond the current VPS.

### Scenarios

| Subscribers | Monthly gross | Monthly net | Annual net |
|-------------|--------------|-------------|------------|
| 100 | $319 | $207 | $2,484 |
| 500 | $1,595 | $1,025 | $12,300 |
| 2,000 | $6,380 | $4,100 | $49,200 |
| 10,000 | $31,900 | $20,500 | $246,000 |

10,000 subscribers to a weird garden email newsletter is not an unreasonable ceiling for a product this specific and this good.

### Revenue Note

The existing script is the asset. The distribution is the business. You've already done the hard part.

## Marketing

### Who Is This For

People who garden and have a sense of humor. People who don't garden but wish they understood it. People who love the idea of Buck Thorn saying five words that mean more than Pedantic Ivy's three paragraphs. Morning routine people who want something that isn't news.

The Venn diagram of "gardeners" and "people who appreciate absurdist ensemble writing" is smaller than the general population and larger than you'd think.

### Channels

**Substack Notes / gardening newsletters** — The gardening newsletter world is enormous and friendly. Guest appearance in an established garden newsletter is worth ten thousand impressions.

**Reddit** — r/gardening (3.5M members), r/vegetablegardening, r/NativePlantGardening. Don't pitch — post a sample dispatch and let it speak for itself. Harry Kvetch will do the marketing.

**Twitter/X gardening community** — Surprisingly active. Garden Twitter is real and passionate. One good Harry Kvetch thread goes a long way.

**The sample dispatch is the ad.** Build it into the signup page, share it everywhere, let people fall for the characters. If they read to the end of a sample they subscribe.

### The "Author Voice" Expansion as Growth Mechanic

Adding Joan Didion, Wendell Berry, Thoreau, Steinbeck, or Toni Morrison as author voice options is:
- A product release that generates press
- A reason for existing subscribers to share ("they added Didion!")
- A natural upsell hook ("upgrade for access to all author voices")
- A genuine creative challenge that makes the product better

Each new author voice is a marketing event.

## Test Coverage

**The goal:** When tests are green, running the DAG works. Period.

**Run all tests:**
```bash
# Node.js (API, webhooks, climate zones, geocoding)
cd /opt/plotlines/server && npm test

# Python (pipeline integration — hits real Postgres, real APIs)
python3 -m pytest ~/openclaw/skills/garden-conversation/test_pipeline.py -v
```

**Both must pass before any commit.**

### Node.js tests (`/opt/plotlines/server/__tests__/`)

All tests run against **real Postgres** (`plotlines_test` DB). Zero SQLite. Zero mocks for DB.

| Suite | What it tests |
|-------|--------------|
| `climate.test.js` | Zone assignment, all 28 zones, boundary conditions |
| `geocode-validation.test.js` | Key West, Juneau, Alaska zones correct |
| `location-outliers.test.js` | Extreme locations: Barrow, international cities |
| `zip-coverage.test.js` | Real lat/lon per zip — sampled US coverage |
| `webhook-zipcode-backfill.test.js` | Stripe backfill: 4 combinations (needsZip × needsGeo) |
| `stripe-webhook.test.js` | Webhook events: checkout, cancel, payment |
| `admin.test.js` | Admin KPIs, international dispatch |
| `beta-invite.test.js` | Beta invite tracking |

### Python integration tests (`test_pipeline.py`)

Tests that verify the actual pipeline stages work:

| Test | What it proves |
|------|---------------|
| DB connectivity | Postgres reachable, combinations exist, zones valid |
| Zone lookup | Every combo's lat/lon resolves to a valid 28-zone name |
| Solar term | `get_current_solar_term()` works for all 28 zones, zone-aware |
| Weather | NWS fetch returns valid condition for each station |
| Art generation | SD 1.5 produces a valid PNG > 10KB |
| Dialogue | LLM returns dialogue > 100 chars |
| Masthead | PIL composites a valid PNG |
| Full dry-run | `garden-dispatch.py --dry-run` exits 0, sent ≥ 1 |
| Email decryption | All active subscriber emails decrypt to valid addresses |

### What green means

If both test suites are green:
- Postgres has valid data (zones, combinations, subscribers)
- Weather API is reachable and returning real data
- Ollama is running and models are loaded
- Art pipeline produces real images
- Emails will actually reach subscribers

**Current state:**

**Test philosophy:** Tests must use real coordinates and real assertions.
Never hardcode math like `(33791/33791)*100 > 85` — that tests nothing.
Never reuse the same lat/lon for multiple zip codes.

| Suite | What it tests |
|-------|--------------|
| `location-outliers.test.js` | Extreme locations: Key West, Juneau, Barrow, international cities |
| `zip-coverage.test.js` | Real lat/lon per zip — Mountain West, Pacific, South, Northeast, AK, FL |
| `geocoding.test.js` | Key West coords correct, Juneau coords correct |
| `webhook.test.js` | Stripe zipcode backfill — 4 combinations (needsZip × needsGeo) |
| `admin.test.js` | Admin auth, KPI queries, international subscriber dispatch |
| `climate.test.js` | Zone assignment rules, boundary conditions |

**Known gaps (test.todo):**
- Puerto Rico, Guam (territories — no zone defined)
- Sub-region flavor text for new zones (hawaii, florida_keys_tropical, etc.)

**Resolved gaps (2026-03-06):**
- ✅ Hawaii → `hawaii` zone
- ✅ Key West → `florida_keys_tropical`
- ✅ Juneau → `alaska_south_coastal`
- ✅ Japan, Brazil, South Africa, Iceland → international zones added

**What good tests caught (2026-03-06):**
- Key West resolving to `high_plains` (wrong Boulder coords in DB)
- Juneau having no zone (missing SE Alaska bounding box)
- `partly_cloudy` being an invalid masthead weather type
- Art layer never being passed to masthead compositor
- Title generation always returning "Patience" (3s timeout, wrong model)

## Shared Infrastructure Checklist

Everything below leverages existing Outerfit LLC infrastructure at zero additional cost:

```
✅ VPS (DatabaseMart RTX Pro 4000 Ada) — shared
✅ Cloudflare DNS — add thegarden.email (or subdomain)
✅ Caddy SSL — add new domain block
✅ Resend — same account, different from address
✅ Stripe — same account, separate product
✅ Infisical — same account, new environment
✅ Sentry — same account, new project
✅ PM2 — add garden server as second process
✅ R2 backups — include garden.db in backup script
✅ Outerfit LLC — legal entity already exists
✅ Chase Ink Cash — business card already exists
```

New costs:
```
Domain: thegarden.email — ~$15/yr (or use garden.outerfit.net for free)
LLM API costs — scale with subscribers, budgeted above
```

## The One Thing That Matters

Harry Kvetch has to be funny. If Harry Kvetch is funny, people subscribe. If Harry Kvetch is funny and Buck Thorn is laconic and Young Fern is earnest and Pedantic Ivy is exhaustingly precise — the product sells itself.

The script already works. Ship it.
